Great ‚Äî thanks for clarifying. Based on your answers, I‚Äôll refine the **PRD MVP** so it reflects your priorities:

---

# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Product Name:** (TBD ‚Äì e.g., LeadCopilot)
**Version:** MVP

---

## 1. **Vision & Goal**

To automate the process of sourcing and qualifying leads for agencies, businesses, and HR teams, by using an AI Copilot that pulls data primarily from **LinkedIn** and **public company websites**. The system will generate a **qualified list of leads** with context and allow users to query the agent for further enrichment (e.g., personalized outreach hooks).

---

## 2. **Objectives**

* Provide **cost-effective lead sourcing** (LinkedIn + public data first, optional enrichment via Apollo/Clearbit if required).
* Deliver a list of **qualified, enriched, and verified leads**.
* Allow the user to **interact with the lead dataset** (e.g., add columns, generate outreach hooks).
* Enable **multi-channel notifications** (in-app + email).

---

## 3. **Target Users**

* Marketing & Sales Agencies
* B2B Businesses
* Recruiters / HR Teams
* Startup Founders

---

## 4. **MVP Scope**

### 4.1 Authentication & Onboarding

* Google OAuth (MVP).
* Profile setup: User gives business/agency info + goals (context for lead qualification).

---

### 4.2 Lead Sourcing & Copilot Flow

1. **Define ICP**

   * User enters ICP details (role, industry, location, company size, etc.) via form or chat-like Q\&A with agent.

2. **Trigger Copilot**

   * Runs asynchronously, sourcing leads from:

     * **LinkedIn profiles** (public data / scraping / API if feasible).
     * **Public company websites**.
     * **Optional**: Apollo/Clearbit (if needed to verify emails).
   * Verified emails required (bounce protection).

3. **Notifications**

   * **In-app** and **email notification** when process is complete.

4. **Lead Results Table**
   Each lead must include:

   * First Name
   * Last Name
   * Verified email
   * LinkedIn profile
   * Company name
   * Role/title
   * Website
   * ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù summary
   * Data points with links (e.g., LinkedIn posts, company updates)
   * Qualification reason (AI-generated)
   * Interest rating (1‚Äì10)
   * **Agent interaction enabled:** User can ask Copilot to enrich data (e.g., *‚ÄúAdd a Hook column with a personalized outreach message‚Äù*).

5. **Download & Export**

   * Leads exportable to **CSV**.

---

## 5. **Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Cost Efficiency:** Prefer free/public sources, use paid APIs (Apollo/Clearbit) only when strictly necessary.
* **Scalability:** Handle parallel searches asynchronously.
* **Accuracy:** Verify email validity.
* **Performance:** Initial sourcing may take minutes depending on depth.
* **Security:** Encrypt user data and lead lists.

---

## 6. **Future Enhancements (Beyond MVP)**

* ICP templates (save & reuse).
* CRM integrations (HubSpot, Salesforce).
* Team collaboration & shared ICPs.
* Automated lead updates (continuous enrichment).
* Advanced filtering (funding stage, hiring signals, tech stack).

---

## 7. **Success Metrics**

* % of verified leads (bounce rate <5%).
* User rating of lead quality (>7/10).
* % of users exporting data or requesting hooks.
* Retention (# of repeated searches per user).

---

## 8. **Tech Stack (Proposed for MVP)**

* **Frontend:** React (Next.js), TailwindCSS
* **Backend:** Node.js (Express/NestJS)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Lead Sourcing:**

  * LinkedIn scraping (public data)
  * Company websites (scraping + enrichment)
  * Apollo/Clearbit (only for verified email if needed)
* **AI Agent:** OpenAI (GPT-4.1-mini / GPT-4.1), LangChain for enrichment + table manipulations
* **Auth:** Google OAuth (via Supabase/Auth0/Firebase)
* **Notifications:** Email (SendGrid/Resend) + in-app alerts
* **Infra:** AWS/Azure/GCP

---

üëâ I suggest we now build a **user flow diagram** that shows:

1. Login ‚Üí Profile setup ‚Üí ICP definition
2. Copilot triggered ‚Üí Async process ‚Üí Notifications
3. Leads table displayed ‚Üí User interacts (ask Copilot to add columns like ‚ÄúHook‚Äù) ‚Üí Export

Would you like me to draft that **visual flow** for the PRD? It would make the MVP clearer for both devs and stakeholders.
